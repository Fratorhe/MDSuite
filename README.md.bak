# LAMMPS Tools
A postprocessing suite for the LAMMPS simulation package.
[LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/)

This program takes the LAMMPS dump file and process it to calculate several properties of the systems often of interest in molecular dynamics simulations.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the main.py script.
```
python main.py
```
This will bring up lists of analysis which may be performed on the system.
## Data Format
This postprocessing suite will take a lammps file and will determine what properties are available for use in the analysis. It also support coordinate unwrapping as well as trivial calculations in order to minimize data requirements.

## Requirements
Requirements.txt contains a full list of python packages required to use this suite but another list with links is given here.
* Numpy [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* Scipy [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* MDAnalysis [mdanalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)

## Analysis 
This suite is capable of calcualting several properties both structrual and dynamic of a system. The following is a breakdown of the capabilitites of the program.

### Radial Distribution Functions
Radial distribution functions are a good strating point for understanding the structure of a material. This program uses the MDAnalysis software to calcualte the RDF's for each eleemnt and elemtn cmbination within the system. It will produce .npy files containing the raw data for the rdf's as well as the plots. This raw data can be re-plotted using some of the post-analysis tools in the tools directory.

### Coordination Numbers
Coordination numbers provides additional data on the neighbour density of the atoms within a system. This allows one in particular to study effects of struture rduction under varying conditions wihtin a system.
