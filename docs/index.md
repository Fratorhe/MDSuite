# About this site
In recent year, machine learning (ML) has seen remarkable success in a number of fields. One in particular, is that of molecular dynamics simulations. This website is dedicated to the cross-over of these fields, with sound theoretical background into topic within each fields, as well as current research into their relation. The authors of this website are all PhD students of physics, studying how machine learning can be introduced into computational methods in order to improve accuracy, performance, or to discover new, previously unknown relationships.

# What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is an umbrella term describing computational methods wherein a computer uses some sort of *training* data to sort or make predictions on new data. These methods can come in many forms, perhaps the most well known method is the Neural Network, which uses a series of connected layers, made up of many neurons, or units, each with an assigned weight to approximate some function. In general, there are numerous kinds of machine learning, each with their ow strengths and weaknesses, many of which are discussed here.


# What is Molecular Dynamics?
Molecular dynamics (MD), or more specifically, molecular dynamics simulations, are a sub-field of computational physics, wherein many body atomic systems are simulated in order to extract electronic, thermophysical, thermodynamic, and many other properties. In practice, molecular dynamics is used for numerous applications, some of which include, 
* Discovery and modeling of new materials
* Understanding complex materials
* Discovering relationships between complex molecules or polymers
* Designing catalysts, drugs, or simply processes for use in industrial or medical professions

# How do these fields relate?
When performing MD simulations, you will have to decide on the accuracy of the simulation. Do you want to a full quantum mechanic treatment?, or do you want large scale dynamic behaviour? Depending on the answer to this question, you will either need some big computers to keep track of all your electrons, or, you will need to choose a mathematical model with which you can replicate the interatomic interactions. With the introduction of some a mathematical model, comes inaccuracy, often through approximations that are not always rooted in theory or experiment. In recent years, there has been increased interest in using machine learning methods to fit such a function, allowing for the atomistic scaled simulations at near quantum mechanical accuracy. This is of course just one way that machine learning is impacting the field. In this site, you will find information discussing many applications, with a sound theoretical background.
